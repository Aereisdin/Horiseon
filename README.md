Horiseon Social Solution

First off I want to give my thanks for the opportunity to work on Horiseon Social Solution webpage!

This project was about making sure the Horiseon application was meeting current accessability standards to improve their user experience.

Some other minor adjustments were also made based on some links that were not functioning correctly which would have led to poor user experience. 

As you view the code you should find that the tags have been reformated to the most current semantic standards used in HTML 5 and alt tags have been assigned to each of the photos.
Previously, the 'Horiseon' in the navigation had a subtle shading on the 'seo' of the name. I've adjusted this to a higher contrast as it is easier to view for people who have difficulty seeing.

The CSS document has been reorganized to match the html tag order so that it is more logical and easy to read and find classes and ids that need modification if needed in the future.
